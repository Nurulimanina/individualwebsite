    <p><i>This is my school! SMK Tengku Idrish Shah , Kapar. I am studied from 2012 until 2016. From form 1 until form 3, I am in class of 3 KAA which is taking Bahasa Arab. Learning Bahasa Arab is the best decsion ever. Its such as memory because, certain people only have a chance to learn Bahasa Arab until standard 6 but I manage to learn until degree. <br>
    Secondary school is the best journey because we can enjoy studies life with friends and teachers. In school we always have a best place that we really love to spend time. I love library! Not because I am a librarian, but library is the most peaceful place in school. When I start my diploma, I still cannot forgot my school journey. Many silly things that I have expereinced in school which make it become sweet memories which I can story with my schoolmate forever!  </i>
